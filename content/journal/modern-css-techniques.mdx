CSS has evolved dramatically in recent years. Here are the techniques I use most frequently in my daily work.

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

Custom properties have changed how I approach theming entirely:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #3b82f6;
  --color-bg: #ffffff;
  --spacing-unit: 0.25rem;
}

.button {
  background: var(--color-primary);
  padding: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 4);
}
```

The killer feature? They're **reactive**. Change them with JavaScript or media queries, and everything updates:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-bg: #0a0a0a;
  }
}
```

## Container Queries

Finally, we can style components based on their container's size, not just the viewport:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  }
}
```

This is game-changing for truly reusable components.

## The :has() Selector

The parent selector we've always wanted. Style a parent based on its children:

```css
/* Style cards that have images differently */
.card:has(img) {
  padding: 0;
}

/* Form validation styling */
.form-group:has(input:invalid) {
  --border-color: red;
}
```

## Logical Properties

Write CSS that works in any writing direction:

```css
/* Instead of: */
margin-left: 1rem;
padding-right: 2rem;

/* Use: */
margin-inline-start: 1rem;
padding-inline-end: 2rem;
```

This is essential for internationalization.

## Modern Layout Techniques

### Subgrid

Finally, nested grids can align with their parents:

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.child {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-column: span 3;
}
```

### Gap for Flexbox

No more margin hacks:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

## Aspect Ratio

Maintain aspect ratios without padding hacks:

```css
.video-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Conclusion

Modern CSS is incredibly powerful. These techniques have simplified my code, reduced JavaScript dependencies, and made responsive design more intuitive.

The browser support for these features is excellent now. If you haven't explored them yet, I encourage you to give them a try in your next project.
