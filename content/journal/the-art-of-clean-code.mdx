Writing clean code is an art that every developer should master. It's not just about making code work—it's about making code that's readable, maintainable, and a joy to work with.

## Why Clean Code Matters

Code is read far more often than it's written. When you write clean code, you're showing respect for:

- Your future self
- Your teammates
- Anyone who will maintain this code

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." — Martin Fowler

## Principles of Clean Code

### 1. Meaningful Names

Names should reveal intent. Avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables (except for loop counters):

```typescript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const yyyymmdd = formatDate(d);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const formattedDate = formatDate(currentDate);
```

### 2. Small Functions

Functions should do one thing and do it well. If a function is doing multiple things, split it up:

```typescript
// Bad
function processUserData(user) {
  // Validate
  if (!user.email) throw new Error('No email');
  if (!user.name) throw new Error('No name');
  
  // Format
  user.email = user.email.toLowerCase();
  user.name = user.name.trim();
  
  // Save
  database.save(user);
  
  // Send welcome email
  emailService.sendWelcome(user.email);
}

// Good
function processUserData(user) {
  validateUser(user);
  const formattedUser = formatUserData(user);
  saveUser(formattedUser);
  sendWelcomeEmail(formattedUser.email);
}
```

### 3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

If you find yourself copying code, it's time to abstract:

```typescript
// Bad
const tax1 = price1 * 0.1;
const total1 = price1 + tax1;

const tax2 = price2 * 0.1;
const total2 = price2 + tax2;

// Good
function calculateTotal(price, taxRate = 0.1) {
  const tax = price * taxRate;
  return price + tax;
}

const total1 = calculateTotal(price1);
const total2 = calculateTotal(price2);
```

### 4. Comments Should Explain Why, Not What

```typescript
// Bad
// Increment counter by 1
counter++;

// Good
// We need to account for the header row
counter++;
```

## Code Organization

### Group Related Code

Keep related functionality together:

```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
    dashboard/
      components/
      hooks/
      utils/
```

### Consistent Formatting

Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to enforce consistent formatting. This removes debates about style and lets you focus on what matters.

## The Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the code better than you found it."

Every time you touch code, make it a little bit cleaner. Fix that confusing variable name. Extract that duplicated logic. Add that missing type.

## Conclusion

Clean code isn't about perfection—it's about continuous improvement. Start with these principles:

1. Use meaningful names
2. Keep functions small and focused
3. Don't repeat yourself
4. Write comments that explain why
5. Organize code logically
6. Always leave code better than you found it

The investment in writing clean code pays off every time someone (including you) needs to understand or modify it.
